This is the second post in the series of my weekly GSOC Sugar Labs, where I summarize my week  of working with [Sugar Labs](https://www.sugarlabs.org) under GSOC.


## Weekly Journal

This week we ventured more in the details of ASLO.  Mailing list recently witnessed a  lively and healthy discussion regarding my proposal. Quoting my mentor Tony
> For better or worse, you are becoming the model of 'bonding'. Any discussion of this project before we get down to cases is to the good. Requests for your proposal resulted in Walter Bender >updating the Sugar Labs wiki with copies (https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Summer_of_Code). . The earlier feedback we can get the better.

So discsussion resulted into engaging members, getting feedbacks and suggestions, which  will eventually shape the direction in which ASLO will move. <br>
I discovered [Matrix](http://matrix.org/) and [Riot](https://riot.im) (which is a frontend for Matrix) and it acts an IRC bouncer which allows me to have a log of all the conversations that happened on a particular channel during the time I was offline (since IRC doesn't allow that by default, you have to use bouncer or always connected proxy server for the said functionality). Check out this [awesome Matrix guide](https://opensource.com/article/17/5/introducing-riot-IRC).<br>
I missed the weekly IRC meeting on  **#sugar-meeting**  which happens every Monday, due to ISP dial up issues :confused:, but  Tayba and Walter were kind enough to provide me the logs of the meeting :smile:.  
Tony provided me with  the [link which desribed the process to request for a shell account](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sysadmin/Add_shell_account) (so I can get proper permissions to host, configure and deploy Django on SugarLabs server), Samuel responded quickly and promised to prepare a VM  by this Saturday. <br>
As part of the GSOC, Google provided everyone with a [free one year subscription of Lwn.net](https://lwn.net/gsoc2017)  :grin:

## Goals for next Week
Everybody welcomed me in the mailing list and was very happy to assist. For the upcoming week, I hope that we reach a shared common vision for the development of ASLO. <br>
As always, if you find any mistake, let me know and I'll fix it.
